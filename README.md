# Robot-Simulation-Movement-According-to-Object-Movement
In this project, OpenCV is used to detect the center of an object from a camera feed, and this information is used to control a robot's movement in real-time within the CoppeliaSim simulation. The system performs color-based object tracking to guide the robot towards the target. Thus, interactive robot control based on visual data is achieved.
